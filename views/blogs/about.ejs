    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>Every story needs a protagonist, and so does every About Us page. In some cases, that might be you or your founding team. In others, you might treat your business as its own character with a distinct story.

        Either way, stories are all about representing change—starting in one place and ending up in another—which is something your About Us page should also do as visitors scroll through it.<br>However, a story is just the start. A good About Us page doesn’t just tell the story behind a company—it shows it.

        Here are some other components you might want to incorporate into your About Us page to not only flesh out your narrative, but to define your brand and communicate your company’s reason for being to customers.</p>
    <p>In short, your About Us page is a home for your founding story, a place to show off your business wins, and a sales page that answers the most pressing question new customers have about your business outside why they should buy its products</p>
